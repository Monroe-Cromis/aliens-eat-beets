Homework 1 

Project Description: 
The hmtl code was redundant so I did what I could to incorporate modern elements of html to clean it up. 
- for example I used Head, Body, Main, and Section tags to make it easier for who ever is reading the code to understand the layout of the page. 

Project improvements: I tried to clean up the CSS code, however it was linked within the initial mock up of the HTML code and when changing it I found that I was changing too much about the layout of the page. Next time, in order to improve I could clean up the HTML even more to make the CSS more accessible to those trying to read it.
